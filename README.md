Machine Learning to predict binding affinities of EGFR inhibitors.

Guide: Dr. Jacob Kongsted, SDU, University of Southern Denmark 
• Employed molecular docking using Glide and BioLuminate to study the receptor-ligand interactions of various
FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, EGFR
• Further machine learning to predict the binding affinities of these ligands with EGFR. This could potentially lead
to a more efficient process of lead identification or drug development.
